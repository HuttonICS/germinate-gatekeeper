# Germinate Gatekeeper
Gatekeeper acts as an authentication mechanism for the Germinate system and allows restricted access to Germinate databases. 

Users can either be created by an administrator or they can register for a user account themselves. Registered users can be given access to instances of Germinate. Once logged in, a user can access the data contained in Germinate. However, the data the user can see may be restricted to specific datasets based on the configuration set up by the administrator.

Germinate Gatekeeper is freely available as a standalone add-on for Germinate.
